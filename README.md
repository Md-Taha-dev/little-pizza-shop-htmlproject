# Little Pizza Shop Website

## Overview
This is my first multi-page website built using HTML. I completed learning HTML and built this project in just **7 days**. The website demonstrates semantic HTML, forms, tables, images, and multi-page navigation.

The website simulates a small pizza shop with multiple pages:  
- Home Page  
- Menu Page  
- Contact Page  
- Store Hours Page

## Key Features
- **Semantic HTML Structure:** Uses `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  
- **Navigation:** Multi-page links, including links opening in new tabs.  
- **Forms:** Contact form using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.  
- **Tables:** Structured tables with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>` and usage of `rowspan` and `colspan`.  
- **Images:** Added with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for semantic clarity.  
- **Interactive Elements:** `<details>` and `<summary>` for expandable content.
